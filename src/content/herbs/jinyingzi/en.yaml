history: |
  First appeared in Grandfather Lei's Discussions of Herb Preparation.

introduction: |
  From the fruit of Rosa laevigata Michx., family Rosaceae.

traditional_usage: |
  Jinyingzi, the Golden Cherry fruit, is sour and neutral in nature, entering the kidney, bladder and large intestine meridians. It is used for stabilising the kidneys and retaining the vital essence. It prevents the leakage of fluids, including urinary incontinence and a frequent need to urinate, and is also able to bind the intestines, stopping diarrhea and dysentery.

modern_usage: |
  Tests have confirmed jinyingzi's ability to reduce the frequency of urination as well as an ability to lower cholesterol and lipoproteins in laboratory animals.

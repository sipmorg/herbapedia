  Found mostly in plant-based oils including evening primrose oil (EPO), borage oil, and blackcurrant seed oil.

  Omega 6 is an essential unsaturated fatty acid, which means it cannot be made by our bodies and must be sourced from food. Most omega-6 fatty acids in the diet come from vegetable oils in the form of linoleic acid, which is converted to gamma-linolenic acid in the body and then further broken down to arachidonic acid. Clinical trials have shown that essential fatty acids protect against conditions including heart disease; cancer; autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis; and skin diseases, including acne, atopic eczema and psoriasis. They may also protect against strokes.

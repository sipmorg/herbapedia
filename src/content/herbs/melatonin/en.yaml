  Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland, located within the brain. Vita Green uses synthetically made melatonin in its supplements.

  Melatonin is a natural hormone that regulates the human biological clock. Double-blind research with young adults has showed that melatonin facilitates sleep. Another study of healthy, young adults found that melatonin significantly shortened the time needed to fall sleep, reduced the number of night awakenings, and improved sleep quality. Melatonin significantly reduces symptoms of jet lag and results in a quicker recovery of preflight energy levels and alertness.

introduction: |
  PABA is found naturally in liver, kidney, brewer's yeast, molasses, whole grains, mushrooms and spinach. It is also produced by intestinal bacteria.

traditional_usage: |
  PABA is involved in the breakdown of protein used in the body. It also helps in red blood cell formation as well as assisting the manufacture of folic acid in the intestines. It supports all the functions of folic acid and is known specifically for helping to nourish healthy hair, and may even restore greying hair its original colour. A deficiency of PABA can cause depression and fatigue.

modern_research: |
  PABA has in the past been used in sunscreen preparations, since it helps to protect the skin against UVB solar radiation. However, it does not block UVA rays, and for this reason is being phased out.

introduction: |
  This colourless to yellowish-white hydrocarbon mixture is derived from petroleum.

traditional_usage: |
  Petrolatum or petroleum jelly is a clear mineral oil jelly best known as a topical treatment for chapped lips and a key ingredient in cosmetics and skin-care products. Topical application of petrolatum can help the skin's outer layer recover from damage. While petroleum jelly itself has no therapeutic properties, it forms a waterproof barrier over the skin, preventing infection and keeping the skin beneath supple by preventing water evaporation.

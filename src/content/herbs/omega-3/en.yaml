introduction: |
  Omega 3 fatty acids are found in cold-water fish including tuna, salmon and mackerel. Plant sources include dark green leafy vegetables, flaxseed oils and certain vegetable oils.

traditional_usage: |
  Omega 3 is an unsaturated essential fatty acid, which means it cannot be produced by the body and must be sourced from food. Omega 3 is thought to reduce the risk of heart disease. Other positive effects include anti-inflammatory and anti-blood clotting actions, lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and reducing blood pressure. Omega 3 fatty acids may also reduce the risks and symptoms of other disorders including diabetes, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, some cancers and mental decline.

modern_usage: |
  Many clinical trials are ongoing into the therapeutic uses of omega 3 oils for a variety of conditions from easing the pain of arthritis and slowing the growth of cancer tumours to lowering the risk of heart attacks.

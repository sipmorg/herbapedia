introduction: |
  Root of Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch., family Scrophulariaceae.

traditional_usage: |
  A sweet, warming herb for the kidney and liver meridians with invigorating and rejuvenating effects. It is used for nourishing the blood, tonifying the liver and kidney yin, replenishing jing (kidney essence) and stopping coughing and wheezing. As a treatment for blood deficiency it is useful in cases of menstrual disorders and anaemia, while its ability to replenish jing means it can be prescribed in cases of premature ageing such as greying hair, dizziness, forgetfulness, impotence and tinnitus. This herb is made from the roots of the Chinese Foxglove, which are harvested in autumn and prepared by stewing in wine.

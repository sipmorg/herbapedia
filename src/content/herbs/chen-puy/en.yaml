history: |
  First appeared in Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica.

introduction: |
  The pericarp of Citrus reticulatta Blanco, family Rutaceae

traditional_usage: |
  Chenpi, made from the rind of tangerine fruits, can regulate the flow of chi, invigorate the functions of the spleen, eliminate damp and help to relieve phlegm and coughs. Bitter and warm in nature, it affects the lung and spleen channels. Its use is indicated where the patient suffers from distention and fullness in the chest and upper abdomen with anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea, and a cough with copious phlegm. Because it aids digestion and absorption, it can be used in multiherb remedies where the other ingredients may overburden the digestive system.

modern_research: |
  A flavonoid in the herb, which is called hesperidin, possesses antiallergic, antioxidative and antistomatitic properties. It has been used to treat mastitis, bronchitis and burns with good results.

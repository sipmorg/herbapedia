  The honey made by bees (Apis cerana Fabricius and A. mellifera L., family Apidae).

traditional_usage: |
  According to Chinese traditional medicine, honey is sweet and neutral in nature, entering the spleen and large intestine meridians and tonifying both associated organs, relieving pain and increasing appetite, as well as treating constipation. It also enters the lung meridian and moistens the lungs to stop coughing. Western medicine also prizes honey for its antiseptic and antibacterial properties, and it has long been used both as a topical treatment for skin ailments and taken internally to relieve sore throats and coughing. The antibacterial properties of honey are the result of the combined effects of low water activity causing osmosis, the presence of hydrogen peroxide and high acidity.

  Honey shows laxative, anti-tumour and detoxifying effects. It can also increase humoral immune functions. Wound gels that contain antibacterial honey and have regulatory approval for wound care are now available to help conventional medicine in the battle against drug resistant strains of the bacteria MRSA.

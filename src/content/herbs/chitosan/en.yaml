introduction: |
  Chitosan is produced by the deacetylation of chitin, which is the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp.

traditional_usage: |
  Chitosan is made commercially from chitin, the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans, and is used as a so-called fat magnet. It has the capability of attracting fat from the digestive system and expelling it from the body so that users can lose weight without eating less.

modern_usage: |
  Chitosan's properties enable it to rapidly clot blood, and it has recently gained approval in the USA for use in bandages and other haemostatic agents. One brand of chitosan-containing bandages was able to quickly stop bleeding in tests conducted by the US Marines, resulting in a 100% survival rate from otherwise lethal arterial wounds.

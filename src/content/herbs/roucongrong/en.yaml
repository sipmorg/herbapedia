  Roucongrong is sweet and salty in taste with warming properties. It enters the large intestines and kidneys.

As a kidney tonic, Roucongrong addresses associated symptoms such as weakness in the joints, soreness in the back and knees, tinnitus, dizziness, loss of hearing and forgetfulness. It is also able to improve hair health, since in Chinese medicine the kidneys are associated with nourishing the hair.

history: |
  The use of white willow bark medicinally is a centuries old practice. Ancient Egyptians used white willow to treat inflammation. The Greek physician Hippocrates also wrote about white willow's medicinal uses in the 5th century B.C.

introduction: |
  White willow bark comes from a tree native to Europe and Asia. The name "white willow" comes from the colour of the leaves, which are covered with fine white hairs.

traditional_usage: |
  The bark of the white willow tree is a source of salicin and other salicylates – compounds which are similar in structure to aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid). Today, white willow bark is often used as a natural alternative to aspirin. Another common use is in dietary supplements as an adjunct for weight loss. It is thought to extend or increase the activity of several thermogenic ingredients in elevating energy expenditure and promoting fat metabolism.

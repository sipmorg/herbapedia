  Fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. And S. sphenanthera Rehd. Et Wils., family magnoliaceae

traditional_usage: |
  Wuweizi is made from the dried berries of schisandra, a woody vine native to northern China. Sour and warm in nature, it affects the kidney, lung and heart meridians. Its actions include containing the leakage of lung chi, stopping coughs, nourishing the kidneys, generating body fluids, binding jing (kidney essence) and calming the spirit. It can be used to treat symptoms of weak kidneys such as spermatorrhea and urinary problems.

modern_usage: |
  Schisandra berries are particularly high in antioxidants, substances which scavenge free radicals and prevent damage to cells that can cause certain diseases and premature ageing. In addition, schisandra contains at least 30 different lignans. Lignans are known to have liver-protective properties and to regenerate damaged liver tissue. Lignans also interfere with a compound called platelet activating factor, which promotes inflammation.

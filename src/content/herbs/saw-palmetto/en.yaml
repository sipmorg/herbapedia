history: |
  Saw palmetto berries were first used by Native Americans as a diuretic and sexual tonic, as well as for stomach ache and dysentery.

introduction: |
  Saw Palmetto is a small, low-growing, dwarf-palm tree, native to southeastern North American, particularly Florida. The extract is prepared from its berries.

traditional_usage: |
  Saw Palmetto is an antiflammatory and anti-exudative. It is believed that Saw Palmetto extract lowers DHT levels in prostate tissue, a substance that causes enlargement of the prostate gland. As a result, Saw Palmetto increases the flow of urine, reduces painful urination and helps to prevent nocturia, the need to urinate frequently during the night.

modern_usage: |
  Several trials have been conducted into Saw Palmetto as an effective, natural treatment for men with an enlarged prostate gland. Studies are also investigating its possible use in preventing male-pattern baldness.

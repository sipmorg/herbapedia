  A key constituent of bones and teeth. Magnesium is also an essential element for cellular metabolism, often as an activator of enzymes - including certain peptidases in protein digestion. It also relaxes nerve impulses, functioning antagonistically to calcium, which is stimulatory, and relaxes the heart muscles, preventing sudden surges in blood pressure.

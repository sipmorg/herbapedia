  Baohe, made from dried mint leaves, is a cooling herb that enters the liver and lung meridians. Its main actions are to release the exterior; dispel wind-heat; clear the head, brighten the eyes and benefit the throat; vent rashes; soothe liver chi stagnation; and disperse turbid chi from the abdomen. It is commonly used in the early stages of feverish illnesses like flu to treat symptoms such as headaches, sore throats, a temperature and a dry mouth.

  Baohe has been found to increase local circulation upon topical application, producing a cooling sensation that can relieve itching and pain. It also has antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties.

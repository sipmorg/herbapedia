It can be used to treat symptoms of liver yin deficiency with rising fire, which include dizziness, vertigo, a flushed face and irritability. It can also address deficiencies of kidney yin and jing (essence), combatting symptoms such as weak bones, a sore back and weight loss. Since the kidneys are responsible for hair health, this herb will also help to improve weak, brittle or greying hair.

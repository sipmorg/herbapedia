traditional_usage: |
  Royal jelly is a secretion made by honey bees and is collected from commercial hives. One healthy hive takes up to six months to produce around 500 grams of royal jelly. It is a naturally rich source of minerals, B-complex vitamins, protein and essential amino acids with antioxidant and anti-fatigue effects. It is a popular tonic and is often added to skin creams. It is also sometimes used to treat allergies; however, anyone allergic to honey or bee stings should not consume royal jelly.

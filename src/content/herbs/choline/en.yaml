  Choline, in the form choline bitartrate, is important for liver health and the prevention of cholesterol build-up. As part of the neurotransmitter acetyl choline, it helps to transmit nerve impulses. It also serves as a methyl donor and is essential for the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine, which forms cell membranes.

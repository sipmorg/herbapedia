history: |
  Yunzhi is mainly found in the Yunnan and Guizhou areas of China, where it grows wild in deep forests. It is one of the most precious herbs in Chinese medicine and has been used for over 2,000 years, first recorded in the Classic of Herbal Medicine. However, it is only in very recent years that the Western world has shown interest in yunzhi following double-blind trials that proved a polysaccharide found in the fungus could significantly improve the health of patients undergoing cancer treatments.

Non-toxic and without side effects, it can be used to help maintain health and wellbeing during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It deters unwelcome cell replication and alleviates the side effects of clinical treatments such as mouth ulcers, vomiting and loss of appetite.

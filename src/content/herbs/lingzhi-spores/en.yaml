introduction: |
  The spore of Ganoderma Lucidum (Leyss. Ex Fr.) Karst. Or G. japonicum (Fr.) Lloyd, family Polyporaceae.

traditional_usage: |
  Lingzhi is reputed to have many medicinal properties: it nourishes the heart and blood; pacifies the spirit; tonifies the chi; relieves coughing symptoms and supports weak digestion. Sweet and neutral in nature, it is suitable for all constitutions and has conventionally been consumed as a general tonic for health maintenance. Its specific applications include deficiency fatigue and insomnia, etc. The spores of the mushroom have particularly strong therapeutic effects as compared to the fruiting body; however, the outer casing of the spores is tough and indigestible, so must be cracked using advanced nanotechnology before coating them immediately to prevent oxidation and preserve the active chemicals.

modern_research: |
  University studies have confirmed lingzhi is able to boost the body's antioxidant levels, deter the growth of unwelcome cell lines, strengthen the immune system, protect kidney cells and has anti-ageing effects; increasing appetite and energy levels, improving sleep and reducing white hair and age spots.

introduction: |
  Methionine is found in significant quantities in meat, fish, beans, eggs, garlic, lentils, onions, yogurt and seeds.

traditional_usage: |
  Methionine is an amino acid that assists in the breakdown of fats and thereby prevents a build-up of fat in the arteries. It also assists with the digestive system and removing heavy metals from the body since it can be converted to cysteine, a precursor to gluthione, which is of prime importance in detoxifying the liver. Methionine is also a great antioxidant as the sulphur it supplies inactivates free radicals.

modern_research: |
  Methionine may also be used to treat depression, arthritis pain and chronic liver disease - although these claims are still under investigation. Some studies have indicated that methionine might improve memory recall.

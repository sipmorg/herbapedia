introduction: |
  The seed of Prunus persica (L.) Batsch or P davidiana (Carr.) Franch.

traditional_usage: |
  Semen Persicae, a Chinese remedy derived from the kernels of ripe peaches, has been traditionally used to resolve problems associated with blood stasis including menstrual disorders, abdominal pain, traumatic injury, flank pain and intestinal abscesses. It also moistens the intestines and unblocks the bowels, making it useful for constipation due to dry intestines. Bitter and neutral in character, it affects the heart, large intestine, liver and lung meridians.

modern_research: |
  More recently peach kernels have been used in skin care to moisturise and rehydrate skin. Peach kernel oil is light and nourishing, containing a blend of useful vitamins including A and E. It easily penetrates the epidermis without leaving a greasy feeling. Medicinally, peach kernels contain phytochemicals that show haematological, anti-inflammatory and laxative effects.

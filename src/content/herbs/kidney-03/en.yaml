history: |
  First appeared in GrandfatherLei's Discussions of Herb Preparation.

introduction: |
  Fruit of Psoralea corylifolia L., family leguminosae.

traditional_usage: |
  Buguzhi is an acrid, bitter herb that is very warming in nature. It enters the kidney and spleen meridians, and is thus useful for tonifying the kidneys and fortifying the yang, consolidating the jing (kidney essence) and warming the spleen. Yang and jing deficiencies allow wind and cold to affect the kidneys, characterised by symptoms such as impotence, a cold and painful lower back, and feelings of prolapse: all of which can be treated with buguzhi. This herb also warms the spleen and stops diarrhea.

modern_research: |
  Clinical studies have confirmed buguzhi possesses antibiotic properties, can dilate the coronary artery, stimulate the immune system, relax the smooth muscles and treat asthma.

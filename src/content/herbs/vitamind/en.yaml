introduction: |
  Found in fortified foods such as dairy products, cheese, margarine and cereals; also found naturally in fish, oysters, cod liver oil, salmon, tuna fish and sardines. Exposure to sunlight or a sunlamp causes the body to convert vitamin D precursor into active vitamin D.

traditional_usage: |
  Vitamin D is essential for many bodily processes. It increases calcium absorption from the small intestine; promotes growth and mineralisation of bones and strong teeth; increases absorption of phosphorus through the intestinal wall and increases resorption of phosphates from the kidney tubules; maintains normal level of citrate in the blood; and protects against the loss of amino acids through the kidneys. A deficiency of vitamin D can cause rickets as well as malformed bones and teeth and has been linked to conditions including bone pain and diabetes.

introduction: |
  Ceramides are composed of sphingosine and a fatty acid. They are found in high concentrations within the membranes surrounding cells.

traditional_usage: |
  Ceramides are bioactive molecules in the skin's epidermis. They form a barrier, protecting against water loss and blocking pollutants, and thus play a key role in keeping skin young and healthy looking. However, with age and environmental exposure, ceramides may be lost, resulting in dryness, fine lines and a rough complexion. Ceramides are a key ingredient in anti-aging and other high-tech beauty creams.

history: |
  In the 18th and 19th centuries, wild yam was used by herbalists to treat female complaints such as menstrual cramps and complications with childbirth. Early Americans primarily used it to treat colic, and it was also used for many other complaints across the Americas, from inflammation to asthma.

  The tubers of wild yam contain high levels of diosgenin, a steroid-like substance with many pharmaceutical uses that can enhance metabolic activity, protect skin from free radicals and stimulate remodeling enzymes.

  Since diosgenin can be used to generate the hormone progesterone in laboratory conditions, it has been used to manufacture hormones and in the development of the birth control pill.
